            <p><cite>"It is a lot of running, we have to make it to practice a bunch of times in a week. There are a lot of early mornings and cramped schedules, especially ahead of a big tournament, but Chanelle loves golf, which makes it all worth it,"</cite>
            says Maureen Wangari, Chanelle's mother.</p>
            <p>Wangari says she enjoys school very much.</p>
            <p><cite>"I love math, numbers are really fun. They help me with golf, you can see how you're doing in the game, just by using math problems."</cite></p>

            <p>This is what Wangari said when I asked her what she wanted to know about North Carolina. <cite>"How is the humidity? It will affect the distance I can hit the ball.
              I really can't wait to go to Disney World, right after the competition we are going there and I am so excited!"</cite></p>

            she used to sneak and follow the other golfers out to the course at school. The trainers came to us and told us to Chanelle
            wanted to give golf a shot and we were really surprised,"</cite> says her mother.</p>
